## Your task

Retract (remove) a source that was previously ingested into the wiki. This handles the full blast radius: raw source deletion, compiled article cleanup, index updates, and optional recompilation.

### Parse $ARGUMENTS

- **source-path**: Path to the raw source file to retract (e.g., `raw/articles/2026-shitcoiner-article.md`). Can be a filename only — will search raw/ for a match.
- **--reason "why"**: Reason for retraction (logged permanently). Required — if missing, ask for it before any mutation.
- **--recompile**: After cleanup, recompile affected articles from their remaining sources. Without this flag, articles are cleaned but not resynthesized.
- **--dry-run**: Show what would happen without making changes.
- **--include-archived**: Explicitly allow retraction inside an archived target
  wiki. Bad preserved evidence should still be retractable.
- **--wiki <name>**: Target wiki (same resolution as other commands)
- **--local**: Use project-local `.llm-wiki-data/`

### Resolve HUB and wiki

**Resolve the wiki.** Do NOT search the filesystem or read reference files — follow these steps:
1. Read `$HOME/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`. If it has `hub_path`, expand leading `~` only (not tildes in `com~apple~CloudDocs`) and prefer that path; use `resolved_path` only as a fallback cache when the expanded `hub_path` is unavailable and `resolved_path` is initialized. If config has only `resolved_path`, use it. If the configured path can be statted but reading `wikis.json` or listing `topics/` fails with `Operation not permitted`, stop and ask the user to grant Full Disk Access/iCloud Drive access to the launcher; do not fall back to `~/llm-wiki-data` or `resolved_path`. Do not write machine-specific `resolved_path` into shared configs.
2. If no config → read `$HOME/llm-wiki-data/_index.md`. If it exists → HUB = `$HOME/llm-wiki-data`. If nothing found, ask the user where to create the wiki.
3. **Wiki location** (first match): `--local` → `.llm-wiki-data/` in CWD; `--wiki <name>` → `HUB/wikis.json` lookup with portable path resolution (`<HUB>`, `~`, absolute, or HUB-relative); if the registry path is stale, fall back to `HUB/topics/<name>`; CWD has `.llm-wiki-data/` → use it; else → HUB.
4. Read `<wiki>/_index.md` to verify. If missing → stop with "No wiki found."

If the resolved wiki is archived, require `--include-archived` before
mutation. Keep the topic archived after the retraction.

### Phase 1: Identify the Source

1. If the source-path is a full path (e.g., `raw/articles/2026-shitcoiner.md`), verify it exists
2. If it's a filename or slug, search `raw/` recursively for a match
3. If multiple matches, present them and ask which one
4. Read the source file — extract title, URL, tags, quality, summary
5. Report: "Found: **{title}** ({path}), ingested {date}"

### Phase 2: Map the Blast Radius

Scan ALL compiled wiki articles to find references to this source:

1. **Grep** all files in `wiki/` for the source filename (e.g., `2026-shitcoiner.md`)
2. For each match, classify the reference type:
   - **frontmatter**: Listed in `sources:` field → will be removed
   - **body-inline**: Mentioned or cited in article body text → flag for review
   - **see-also**: Listed in "See Also" or "Sources" section → will be removed
3. Also check `_index.md` files for references

Report the blast radius:
```
Blast radius for "Shitcoiner's Guide to Bitcoin Scaling":

| Article | Reference Types | Impact |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| wiki/concepts/bitcoin-scaling.md | frontmatter + 2 body-inline | HIGH — claims may need rewriting |
| wiki/concepts/lightning-network.md | frontmatter + see-also | LOW — only metadata, no inline claims |
| wiki/topics/layer-2.md | frontmatter + 1 body-inline | MEDIUM — one claim needs review |

Total: 3 articles affected, 3 inline claims to review
```

If `--dry-run`, stop here and report what would happen.

### Phase 3: Clean Up Compiled Articles

For each affected article:

1. **Remove from `sources:` frontmatter** — delete the line referencing the retracted source
2. **Remove from "Sources" section** — delete the link/reference line
3. **Flag inline claims** — for each body-inline reference:
   - Wrap the claim in a retraction marker:
     ```markdown
     <!--RETRACTED-SOURCE: claim below originally sourced from {filename}, retracted {date}: {reason}-->
     [Claim text that needs review]
     <!--/RETRACTED-SOURCE-->
     ```
   - This makes flagged claims visible and searchable without deleting potentially valid information
4. **Update `updated:` date** in frontmatter
5. **Check if article still has sources** — if `sources:` is now empty, flag: "WARNING: {article} has no remaining sources. Consider deleting or recompiling."
6. **Adjust confidence** — if the retracted source was the only high-credibility source, downgrade confidence

### Phase 4: Delete the Raw Source

1. Delete the raw source file
2. Remove its entry from `raw/{type}/_index.md`
3. Decrement source count in `raw/_index.md`
4. Decrement source count in master `_index.md`

### Phase 5: Log the Retraction

Append to `log.md`:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] retract | "{title}" — reason: {reason} → {N} articles affected, {N} claims flagged for review
```

Append same to hub `HUB/log.md`.

### Phase 6: Optional Recompile (--recompile)

If `--recompile` is set, for each affected article with body-inline claims:

1. Read the article's remaining sources (from updated `sources:` frontmatter)
2. Re-read each remaining raw source file
3. Rewrite the flagged sections using only the remaining sources
4. Remove the `<!--RETRACTED-SOURCE-->` markers
5. If no remaining sources cover the claim, delete it entirely and note the deletion
6. Update the article's `updated:` date

Report:
```
Recompiled 2 articles:
- bitcoin-scaling.md: 2 claims rewritten from remaining sources, 0 claims removed
- layer-2.md: 0 claims rewritten, 1 claim removed (no other source covers this)
```

### Phase 7: Final Report

```markdown
## Retraction Complete

**Source retracted**: {title} ({path})
**Reason**: {reason}
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

### Impact
- Articles affected: N
- Inline claims flagged: N
- Claims recompiled: N (if --recompile)
- Claims removed: N (if --recompile, no remaining source)

### Articles Modified
| Article | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| {path} | Removed from sources, {N} claims flagged/rewritten |

### Remaining Review Items
- [ ] {article}: review claim at line {N} (flagged but not recompiled)

### Verification
Run `/pkb:doctor` to verify no dangling references remain.
```

### Edge Cases

- **Source used by 0 articles**: Just delete it, update indexes, log it. No article cleanup needed.
- **Source is the ONLY source for an article**: Warn prominently. With `--recompile`, the article would be gutted. Recommend deletion instead: "Article {name} has no remaining sources after retraction. Consider `/pkb:retract` on the article itself, or manually rewriting with new sources."
- **Multiple sources to retract**: Run retract once per source. Each run is atomic and logged independently.
- **Retracted source referenced in another raw source**: Raw sources are immutable — don't modify them. Only compiled articles are cleaned up.
